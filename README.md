# Task 2

What should be done
Preparation

In the first task, you will need to write a gRPC client in any other language you like, so you probably need to install some dependencies.
You need to install Kafka for the second task (or Docker if you want to run it in a container)
Main

# gRPC part (2 point)
{ "message": "Ping" } And responses with something like this (feel free to add more fields){ "message": "Pong" }
* Create a simple Java gRPC client application that sends a request to the simple server (share the same proto file), gets a response, and prints it.
* Create a simple gRPC client application in any other language you like (or ask a trainer/lector for a Python example) that sends a request to the simple server, gets a response, and prints it. Use the same proto file.
* Start a server and try to communicate with it using the clients you just wrote.

# Avro part (3 point)
In this task, you need to create a Kafka producer and consumer using Avro to serialize messages.

* Create a simple Kafka producer that sends a simple message to a topic serializing it using Avro.
* Create a simple Kafka consumer which listens to a topic for a message, deserializes the message, and prints it.
 
Start Kafka, create a topic, and run consumer and producer.
Try to use different Avro schemas for serialization and deserialization. 
Include Avro schema version/id into the massage so a client can understand which schema to use.

When practical task is implemented and ready for verification please upload an archive (jar, zip) with resources to the Result field and submit the results.
